# textLayer
textLayer is a project that I have been working on that is written in Python. The purpose of textLayer is to connect to and log in to Cengage's website and download the pages of textbooks that are otherwise unavailable for download. It's support is more than likely spotty, but it works for the books that I needed access to on-the-go and had already paid to access. This project is not intended for illegal uses, but to grant offline access to the online material that you have paid money for already.
